#Comment Box Challenge

## Background
Darn! Our programmer left without warning (said something about starting anew and living off the land). We needed this UI element finished yesterday. As our new front-end engineer, coordinate with the back-end team, and finish up this task.

## Goal
Using the prototype and specs in mockup/mockup.png and mockup/specs.txt, implement the comment box using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Feel free to make changes to the pre-existing code base.

## Extra Information
### Included HTTP Server Module
If you, for whatever reason, need an portable HTTP server to host these files, you can use the provided Python 2 module to start a Simple HTTP server with CORS enabled. Use the command below:

``` python simple-cors-http-server-py2.py [port] ```
