#Comment Box Challenge

## Background
Darn! Our programmer left without warning (said something about starting anew and living off the land). We needed this UI element finished yesterday. As our new front-end engineer, coordinate with the back-end team, and finish up this task.

## Goal
Using the prototype and specs in mockup/mockup.png and mockup/specs.txt, implement the comment box using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Feel free to make changes to the pre-existing code base.
